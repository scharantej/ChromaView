## **Flask Application Design: Create a Blog about Colors**

### **HTML Files:**

**1. base.html:**
   - This serves as the master template for all pages.
   - It contains common elements like the header, footer, and navigation menu.

**2. index.html:**
   - This is the home page of the blog.
   - It displays a list of all colors, allowing visitors to access individual color pages.

**3. color.html:**
   - This page is a template for individual color pages.
   - It displays information about a specific color, such as its name, hue, and hexadecimal code.

**4. about.html:**
   - This page contains information about the blog and its author.
   - It can include details such as the blog's purpose, the author's background, and contact information.

### **Routes:**

**1. @app.route('/'):**
   - This is the route for the home page.
   - It returns the `index.html` file, displaying the list of colors.

**2. @app.route('/color/<color_name>'):**
   - This route is for individual color pages.
   - It takes a `color_name` as an argument, which is used to select and display the corresponding color information using the `color.html` template.

**3. @app.route('/about'):**
   - This route is for the about page.
   - It returns the `about.html` file, displaying information about the blog and its author.

### **Database:**

- The application can use a simple database, such as SQLite, to store color information.
- The database should have a table named 'colors' with columns like 'color_name,' 'hue,' and 'hex_code.'
- The application can use Flask-SQLAlchemy to interact with the database and retrieve color information.

### **Additional Considerations:**

- To make the blog more visually appealing, CSS can be used to style the HTML pages.
- The application can be extended to allow users to add or edit colors, resulting in a dynamic and interactive blog.
- Implementing user authentication would enable users to create accounts and maintain their own color collections.
